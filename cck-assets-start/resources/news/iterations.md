Our friends of [Creative Coding Utrecht](https://creativecodingutrecht.nl) are organising a new edition of [Iterations](https://iterations.online/). This time, the event will take place at Design Museum Den Bosch, but you can also attend online.

How do recent technological developments empower makers to generate new creative avenues? How is the creative coding landscape going to evolve in the coming few years? These questions will be explored during the creative coding symposium ITERATIONS.
